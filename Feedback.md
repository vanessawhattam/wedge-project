## Feedback 

Nice work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 

> it got me from A to B (and hopefully to an A)

ðŸ˜‚ Even without contract grading, I hope you know you'd be getting an A in the class. You've done very good work and are fastidious about deadlines. 

### Task 1

* The submitted version hits a file-not-found error in cell 5ish. It looks a little weird to have that be the committed copy. If the file indeed does run, then it's fine to just clear outputs before submission.
* Those two cells are also duplicated, I think. That's worth cleaning up. 
* The "sorting" approach to your testing file is a bit odd. Imagine we had dozens of different delimiters or other oddities. It's not sustainable to sort them all.
* Given those choices above, the upload code is as clean as possible. 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* It'd be worth thinking through how you'd do this the reproducible way. That'd involve selecting distinct card numbers, pulling them down to python, calling `random.sample` and then building a query that could use them all. Let me know if it's not clear how you'd do that. 

### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient.
